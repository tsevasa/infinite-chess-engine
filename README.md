# HydroChess WASM

A Rust-based chess engine compiled to WebAssembly for infinite chess variants.

## Features

### Engine Capabilities

- **Coordinate-based board**: Supports arbitrary piece positions (not limited to 8x8)
- **Multiple piece types**: Standard chess + fairy pieces (Amazon, Chancellor, Archbishop, Centaur, Hawk, Knightrider, etc.)
- **Iterative deepening search** with time management
- **Alpha-beta pruning** with aspiration windows
- **Null move pruning** and **late move reductions (LMR)**
- **Transposition table** with Zobrist hashing
- **Killer moves** and **history heuristic** for move ordering
- **Quiescence search** for tactical accuracy
- **Coordinate normalization** for infinite board positions

### WASM Interface

```rust
// Create engine from game state
let engine = Engine::new(json_state)?;

// Get best move (default time control)
let best_move = engine.get_best_move();

// Get best move with custom time limit
let best_move = engine.get_best_move_with_time(500); // 500ms

// Get all legal moves (for opening generation, UI, etc.)
let moves = engine.get_legal_moves_js();

// Run perft for testing
let nodes = engine.perft(5);
```

### Evaluation

- **Material counting** with piece values
- **Piece-square tables** for positional evaluation
- **King safety** evaluation
- **Pawn structure** analysis
- **Endgame detection** and specialized evaluation
- **Insufficient material** draw detection

## Building

### Browser Target (default)

```bash
wasm-pack build --target web
```

Output in `pkg/` - use with bundlers (esbuild, webpack, etc.)

### Node.js Target (for SPRT testing)

```bash
wasm-pack build --target nodejs --out-dir pkg-node
```

Output in `pkg-node/` - use with Node.js directly

## Usage in JavaScript

```javascript
import init, { Engine } from './pkg/hydrochess_wasm_v2.js';

await init();

// Game state in coordinate format
const gameState = {
    board: {
        pieces: [
            { x: "1", y: "1", piece_type: "r", player: "w" },
            { x: "5", y: "1", piece_type: "k", player: "w" },
            // ... more pieces
        ]
    },
    turn: "w",
    castling_rights: ["1,1", "5,1", "8,1"],  // Rook/King positions with rights
    en_passant: null,  // or { square: "x,y", pawn_square: "x,y" }
    halfmove_clock: 0,
    fullmove_number: 1,
    move_history: []
};

const engine = new Engine(gameState);
const bestMove = engine.get_best_move();
// Returns: { from: "5,2", to: "5,4", promotion: null }
```

## SPRT Testing

The engine includes a comprehensive SPRT (Sequential Probability Ratio Test) tool, exposed through a
**web-based UI** that compares an old vs new WASM build directly in the browser.

# Start the web SPRT helper (builds web WASM + starts dev server)

```bash
cd sprt
npm run dev
```

This script:

- Treats the root `pkg` directory as the **OLD** engine snapshot
- Builds a new **web** WASM into `pkg-new` via `wasm-pack build --target web --out-dir pkg-new`
- Copies both into `sprt/web/pkg-old` and `sprt/web/pkg-new`
- Starts `npx serve .` in `sprt/web` so the browser UI can import both

Then in your browser, open:

- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000/`

From there you can configure and run SPRT entirely in the UI.

Features:
- **Web-based control panel**: Configure bounds preset/mode, alpha/beta, time per move, concurrency, min/max games
- **Parallel game playing in browser**: Uses Web Workers for concurrency
- **Standard SPRT bounds presets**: `stockfish_ltc`, `stockfish_stc`, `top30`, `top200`, `all`
- **Gainer vs non-regression modes**: Hypothesis testing for different scenarios
- **Random coordinate-based openings**: Random legal white first move, shared by a **pair** of games
- **Color-reversed pairs**: For each opening, one game with the new engine as White, one with the old engine as White
- **Even-game termination**: SPRT will only stop after completing full pairs
- **Rich logging and downloads**:
    - Game progress log with W/L/D, Elo, LLR and opening tag
    - Final / aborted summary blocks
    - Downloadable plain-text logs
    - Downloadable ICN-style game list with `[Result "..."]` metadata
