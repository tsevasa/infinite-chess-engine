## ✨ Features

### Search
- **Iterative deepening** with aspiration windows
- **Alpha-beta pruning** with principal variation search
- **Null move pruning** and **late move reductions (LMR)**
- **Transposition table** with Zobrist hashing
- **Killer moves** and **history heuristic** for move ordering
- **Quiescence search** for tactical accuracy
- **Static Exchange Evaluation (SEE)** for capture pruning
- **Lazy SMP Multithreading**: Scalable parallel search with runtime implementation dispatch

### Evaluation
- Material counting with tuned piece values
- Piece-square considerations for positional play
- King safety evaluation
- Pawn structure analysis (isolated, doubled, passed pawns)
- Endgame detection with specialized mop-up evaluation
- Insufficient material draw detection

### Infinite Chess Support
- **Coordinate-based board**: Arbitrary positions (not limited to 8x8)
- **Fairy pieces**: Amazon, Chancellor, Archbishop, Centaur, Hawk, Knightrider, Rose, Huygen, and more
- **Variant-specific evaluation**: Chess, Confined Classical, Obstocean, Pawn Horde, Palace

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install Rust and wasm-pack (see docs/SETUP.md for details)
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install wasm-pack

# 2. Build for browser (Single-threaded)
wasm-pack build --target web

# 3. Build for browser (Multi-threaded / Lazy SMP)
node build_mt.js

# 4. Output is in pkg/ - ready for use with your bundler
```

For detailed setup instructions, see **[docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md)**.

## 📖 Usage

### JavaScript API

```javascript
import init, { Engine } from './pkg/hydrochess_wasm.js';

await init();

const engine = new Engine(gameStateJson);

// Get best move with time limit (milliseconds)
const result = engine.get_best_move_with_time(500);
// Returns: { from: "5,2", to: "5,4", promotion: null, eval: 34 }

// Get all legal moves
const moves = engine.get_legal_moves_js();
```

### Multithreaded usage (Lazy SMP)

To use parallel search, you must initialize the WASM module's thread pool and set the desired number of threads:

```javascript
import init, { Engine, initThreadPool } from './pkg/hydrochess_wasm.js';

await init();

// Initialize thread pool (e.g., 2 threads)
await initThreadPool(2);

const engine = new Engine(gameState);
const result = engine.get_best_move_with_time(1000); // Now uses 2 threads
```

> [!NOTE]
> Parallel WASM requires specific HTTP headers (`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`) to be served by your web server.

### Game State Format

```javascript
const gameState = {
    board: {
        pieces: [
            { x: "1", y: "1", piece_type: "r", player: "w" },
            { x: "5", y: "1", piece_type: "k", player: "w" },
            // ... all pieces
        ]
    },
    turn: "w",
    special_rights: ["1,1", "5,1", "8,1"],
    en_passant: null,
    halfmove_clock: 0,
    fullmove_number: 1,
    move_history: [
        { from: "5,2", to: "5,4", promotion: null },
        // ... moves played
    ],
    game_rules: {
        promotion_ranks: { white: ["8"], black: ["1"] },
        promotions_allowed: ["q", "r", "b", "n"],
        win_conditions: { white: ["checkmate"], black: ["checkmate"] }
    }
};
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all unit tests
cargo test --lib

# Run with coverage
cargo llvm-cov --lib

# Run perft tests (move generation validation)
cargo test --test perft
```
